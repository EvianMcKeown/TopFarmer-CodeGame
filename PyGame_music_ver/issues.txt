# restart goes to first lvl [FIXED]
# new game does not display first task [FIXED]
# farm stats reset with each level
    - happens because farm is initialised
    - possible fix: restore stats on init (save to file)
                    or store stats elsewhere

# unlocked lvls must be saved and loaded also.[FIXED]
# "restart" needs to reset inventory. retry after level failure resets inventory successfully
# crop farm config does not reset correctly. 
# crop farm config sometimes places several crops on one tile [FIXED (for 1st instance)] but not for restart
# when selecting another lvl from lvl page, sometimes old tiles remain. eg: grass farm into crop farm config-> grass shows behind some crop
	to see: choose lvl 7 then lvl 5 from lvl page.....then restarting places crops on top of eachother still, 
# restart too many times and game crashes with error:\CodeGame-Capstone-brunch\PyGame_Embedded_Tkinter_levels\embed_pygame.py", line 88, in render_farm
    farmer_x, farmer_y = self.farm.farmer.get_pos() [FIXED]
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



REFACTORINGS TO FIX DEADLOCKS N STUFF - possible reason for not updating properly
join threads, terminate then exit
locks maybe idk? could be stale data causing crop farm config issues
